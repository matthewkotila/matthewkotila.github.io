title: Wolfio
description: Solve complicated mathematical problems via SMS.

---

Wolfio is an SMS service for computing complicated mathematical problems using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/api) and [Wolfram's](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/) APIs. This service can process user queries on several topics such as calculus, linear algebra, and algebra.

## Stimulus
HackingEDU (education-related hackathon in San Mateo, CA) was rolling around the corner, and my partner had an epiphany. After just being released from a math class, he took out his phone to check the solution to a problem. That was when the idea of creating an SMS service for solving complicated mathematical problems began.

SMS stands for "Short Message Service" and had an estimated [3.5 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service) active users in 2010. This is an overwhelming number of people. About [half](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/smartphones-outsell-dumb-phones-globally/) of all cell phones sold in 2013 were so-called "dumbphones" (non-smartphones). Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are using devices without easy access to the internet, and the best part about Wolfio is that it does not require an internet connection. It transmits data over cellular networks via SMS communications protocols.

## Ideology
Math is a powerful field of study and an integral (no pun intended) part of everyday life. The ability to perform complex mathematical operations such as calculus and linear algebra from the device (no matter how dumb) in one's pocket is a powerful ability. I am a firm believer in the freedom of information, and allowing hundreds of millions of people in developing nations without easy access to smartphones or wireless telecommunication services (3G, 4G LTE, etc.) access to information is the first step towards initiating a globally educated body. Many people do, however, have access to cellular networks on which SMS and MMS communications are possible.

## How: Twilio
Wolfio is a combination of several web application technologies. The backed is a Flask server written in Python designed to communicate with Twilio's servers. Twilio allows the web app to receieve text messages and send text messages to users over a cellular network. To describe the web app process as bluntly as possible:
* User texts designated "Twilio number".
* Our server's main function gets called and passed the sender information and text message body.
* Our backend parses the user input and calls our custom written Wolfram's APIs to determine the solution to the user input.
* The result (as a string) is sent to the user via Twilio.
* User recieves answer to complicated math problem.

The "Twilio number" mentioned above is an actual phone number that Twilio provides, to which the user texts his or her queries.

{% highlight py %}
def main():
	#acquire user's phone number
	from_number = request.values.get('From', None)

	#acquire body from user's text message
	body = request.values.get('Body', None)

	#create response object to send to user
	resp = twilio.twiml.Response()

	"""retrieveTokens() is the powerhouse for the app, does all
	parsing and returns relevant result"""
	resp.message("Answer: " + retrieveTokens(str(body)))

	"""return value is the result, which gets sent to the
	user's mobile device"""
	return str(resp)
{% endhighlight %}

This snippet of python code from the main python file for the server outlines the basic process of how a text is received and sent.

## How: Wolfram Development Platform

Inside of the `retrieveTokens()` function, calls are made to our custom written Wolfram APIs. The APIs were written using the Wolfram Development Platform. We currently have twelve different math functions the user can take advantage of along with countless combinations of those functions or general mathematical expressions (simple queries such as `sin(Pi/2)-1/e^2`).

Below is an example of an API for definite integration written using the Wolfram Development Platform:

{% highlight js %}
CloudDeploy[ APIFunction[ { "q" -> "String", "withRespect" -> "String", "min" -> "String", "max" -> "String" },
	Integrate[ ToExpression[ #q, TraditionalForm ], { ToExpression[ #withRespect, TraditionalForm ],
	ToExpression[ #min, TraditionalForm ], ToExpression[ #max, TraditionalForm ] } ] & ], "INDfunction",
	Permissions->"Public" ]
{% endhighlight %}

This function takes a `q` string (the user's expression), a `withRespect` string (the variable to integrate with respect to), a `min` string (the lower bound of integration), and a `max` string (the upper bound of integration). These inputs are then sent to Wolfram's built-in integration function, which returns the result of the integration. Most of the Wolfram API functions are structured in this way.


# The Future
This sort of structuring of Wolfram's writeable APIs provides the means to easily scale this web application. The Wolfram Development Platform allows us access to all of their built-in APIs to compute results for complicated queries. Because of this, more mathematical functions can easily be incorporated into Wolfio.

This app was built in less than twenty four hours, and just scratches the surface of the potential from combining the computational power of Wolfram with the telecommunicative reach of Twilio.
